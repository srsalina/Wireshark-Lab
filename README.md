# Wireshark Lab

## Project Description


This project demonstrated how I used Wireshark to investigate network traffic data as a security analyst for a hypothetical company. The primary focus was to analyze a network packet capture file to identify source and destination IP addresses, inspect protocols used during web browsing sessions, and analyze data packets to understand the information exchanged between systems. To achieve this, I applied various filters to view specific types of traffic and used Wireshark's graphical user interface for detailed packet analysis. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of network traffic analysis and the use of Wireshark to monitor and investigate security issues.

### Skills Learned


- Proficiency in capturing and analyzing network traffic
- Ability to inspect individual network packets to extract detailed information such as IP addresses, protocol details, and payload content
- Enhanced understanding of using packet sniffing tools for security purposes
- Learned to apply and customize display filters in Wireshark to focus on specific types of traffic such as TLS handshakes

## Procedure

### Demonstrating Filters on an Ethernet Port Capture

For my first task, the IT manager wanted me to visit a few websites and demonstrate how to create a capture file. Once created, I needed to demonstrate using various display filters to find important packet information. This task is broken down into the following steps: 
 
1. I began by clearing the browser cache. This way, I would not view any cached websites in my packet capture and would only view the most recent version of any websites from which I intended to capture packets.
2.
